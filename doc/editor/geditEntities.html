<P>
</B>Entities are point data such as player start locations, and non-locational
data such as level attributes that you define for each level.  The system defines
two special entity types--light and spotlight--that you use when you're
applying lighting effects to your level.  Any other entity types are user-defined. 
User defined entities have arbitrary properties which are defined by the
application programmer in cooperation with the level designers.  The programmer creates
a C header file that describes the custom entities, and places that file in
the editor's extensions directory.  The details of the C header file syntax are
given in Appendix A.
<P>
An entity contains data that is packaged with the level and made available to
the programmer directly at program startup time.  Each entity has a list of
properties that you may edit.  These properties can be of may different types: 
numbers, text strings, colors, and locations being the most commonly used.
<P>
When you create an entity, the editor assigns it a name that consists of the
entity type with an appended number.  Each entity of a particular type is given
a different number in order to make the entity names unique in a level.  For
example, the first light in a level would be assigned the name &quot;light1&quot;, the
second &quot;light2&quot;, etc.  Currently, you cannot rename entities.
