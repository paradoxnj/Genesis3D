<P>
</B>Template Mode is where the level designer starts. In this mode, you can choose
from a set of predefined primitive brush templates to shape. All minor modes
are available when shaping brush templates. The brush primitives are selected
and configured through the Template Options Page. The buttons at the top of this
page select from the different brush primitives: Box, Sphere, Cylinder,
Staircase, Arch, and Cone. When you select a primitive, the blue template brush in the
view windows changes to match that brush. You can then shape or move the
geometry in any of the three orthographic views. The template doesn't actually
become geometry in the level until you hit the Enter key when in one of the
orthographic views, which places the brush into the level. Once you've dropped the
brush into the level, you can modify it by selecting it from Select Mode, and then
selecting a minor mode.
<P>
When you place the template brush into the level, it is textured with the
current texture. You can change the current texture for the template by going to
the Textures Option Page, selecting a texture, and hitting the Apply button. Note
that changing the current texture affects the current template brush and all
subsequent template brushes.
<P>
Note that on the Template page there are a some items other than the geometry
primitives. These are used for dropping entities and object library items into
the level. These will be discussed later.
