<P>
</B>In Select Mode, you can select and modify existing brushes and entities. When
you switch to Select Mode, the blue template brush disappears. You can then
click in any of the four views to select brushes or entities. Once you select a
brush, you can choose a minor mode to modify it. A minor mode must be in effect
before you can modify a brush.
<P>
To select multiple brushes and/or entities, hold the Ctrl key down while
selecting. When multiple brushes or entities are selected, the Scale and Shear minor
modes become unavailable. The only operations you can perform on multiple
selections are move, rotate, and delete.
<P>
To move selected items, select Move mode, and then click the left mouse button
and drag in the orthographic view in which you want to move the items.
<P>
To rotate selected items, select Move mode, and then click the right mouse
button and drag horizontally in the orthographic view in which you want to rotate
the items. Moving to the right rotates the items clockwise. Moving to the left
rotates the items counter-clockwise.
<P>
To Scale or Shear a brush, select the brush that you want to modify, select
Scale or Shear mode, and then click and drag in one of the orthographic views. As
you move around in the view, the mouse cursor will change to show how the
Shear or Scale operation will affect the selected brush.
<P>
If you have brushes or entities selected, and no minor modes are selected, you
may clone the selections by holding down the Shift key, and dragging the
selections. A copy of the selections is placed in the level and will be
dragged--keeping the original selections in place. This is useful for rapid creation of
like geometry. For example, if you want a bunch of pillars in a hallway, you can
build one, then select it and clone it many times from the Top view very rapidly.
<P>
You may also alter the textures for selected brushes. To do this, select a
texture from the Textures Option Page and click the Apply button. All selected
brushes will then be textured with the selected texture. You may also change a
brush's attributes from the Brush Attributes dialog, available from the menu or
from the toolbar.
<P>
If more detailed control is required, you can select individual brush faces to
be textured. To do this, select a brush, and then hit the PgDn key to switch
the editor into Face Selection mode. You can switch back to Brush Selection mode
by hitting PgUp. When faces are selected, you can select other faces either by
clicking on a face in the Textured view (note here that face selection is not
available in the orthographic views), or by using the left/right arrow keys to
step through the faces on the selected brush. When a face is selected,
application of a texture applies only to that face. You can then modify a face's
attributes through the Face Attributes dialog, available from the menu or from the
toolbar.
