<P>
</B>The Brush Attributes dialog box allows you to change the attributes of the
selected brushes. To view the Brush Attributes dialog, select one or more brushes,
and then click on the Face/Brush Attributes toolbar button.
<P>
This dialog allows you to set the brush's type to one of the six brush types
described in the table below.

<BR></B></FONT></TD><TD><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Description
<BR></B></FONT></TD></TR><TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Solid
<BR></FONT></TD><TD><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">A solid piece of geometry such as a wall, floor, ceiling, door, etc. A solid
brush blocks visibility and blocks passage.
<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Empty
<BR></FONT></TD><TD><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">An empty space. Empty is useful for creating pools and other things that
contain liquids. An empty brush is translucent but doesn't block passage.
<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Window
<BR></FONT></TD><TD><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">A translucent piece of geometry. Allows visibility but blocks passage.
<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Clip
<BR></FONT></TD><TD><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">A clip brush is an invisible piece of geometry that blocks passage, but is
entirely see-through. Clip brushes are useful for preventing access to parts of a
level without having to build a solid wall.
<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Hint
<BR></FONT></TD><TD><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">A hint brush is invisible and doesn't block passage. Hint brushes instruct the
level compiler to split along a particular plane. Their sole purpose is to
help the level compiler generate a more efficient level.
<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Cut
<BR></FONT></TD><TD><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">A Cut brush carves a hole in existing geometry.
<BR></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">You may also set other attributes, based upon the brush type. For example, if
the brush's type is Empty, you can set any (or none) of Wavy, Transparent, or
Detail. For a Solid brush, however, Translucent isn't an option. The attributes
are described in the table below.
<P>
</FONT><TABLE><TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Attribute
<BR></B></FONT></TD><TD><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Description
<BR></B></FONT></TD></TR><TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Translucent
<BR></FONT></TD><TD><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">If the brush's Translucent flag is set, then you will be able to see through
the brush. The Value setting determines how see-through the brush is, with a
Value of 0 representing transparent and a Value of 255 representing completely
opaque.
<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Hollow
<BR></FONT></TD><TD><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">A hollow brush is a piece of geometry with a hole cut out of it. You aren't
allowed to set this flag from the Brush Attributes dialog (only from the brush
template dialogs), but you are allowed to set the Hull (wall) Thickness for
hollow brushes.
<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Wavy
<BR></FONT></TD><TD><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">If you enable the Wavy flag for an Empty brush, the texture with which the
brush is filled will &quot;wave&quot; or animate to simulate moving liquid.
<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Detail
<BR></FONT></TD><TD><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The Detail flag helps the compiler run more efficiently by removing some
pieces of geometry from visibility and lighting calculations. Window brushes, for
example, are always set to Detail.
<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Area
<BR></FONT></TD><TD><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The Area flag is set on model brushes (such as doors) that physically separate
two parts of a level. This flag allows the rendering engine to ignore very
large portions of the world if the area brush is visible, which makes rendering
much faster.
<BR></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">When multiple brushes are selected, the values displayed in the dialog box are
from the first selected brush.  If you change a value in the dialog box, that
value is set in all of the selected brushes.
