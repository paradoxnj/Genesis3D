</H1></B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">When the editor is started, two toolbars are present. The lower toolbar has
three buttons at the left which control the main modes of the editor. They are,
from left to right, Camera Mode, Selection Mode and Template Mode. The next
three toolbar items in the second toolbar control the minor modes. These are, from
left to right, Move Mode, Scale Mode and Shear Mode.
<P>
The editor is a modal tool. It has three main modes, and a number of minor
modes. You create geometry using the principles of constructive solid geometry
(CSG). In this technique you modify and combine primitive objects to form more
complex objects. You can also use primitive objects to carve out geometry from
existing solid pieces.
<P>
The three main modes are Template, Selection and Camera. In Template Mode, you
configure the basic shape of a geometry template (called a 'brush') and choose
an initial texture for it. You can then place that shaped brush into the
level. You modify existing brushes when in Selection Mode, and you use Camera Mode
for navigating through the views of the geometry that the editor supports.
<P>
The minor modes of the editor are Move, Scale and Shear. When the editor is in
Move Mode, you can move and rotate brushes, but you can't change their shape.
You use Scale Mode to resize brushes, and Shear Mode to shape brushes in ways
that are not easily supported by scaling.
