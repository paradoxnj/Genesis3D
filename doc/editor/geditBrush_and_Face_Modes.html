<P>
</B>There is also a special mode toggle that you use when texturing your level. 
The PgDn key toggles between face mode and brush mode.  When you're editing
geometry and placing levels (that is, most of the time), the editor is in Brush
mode because you're editing brushes.  In this mode, clicking on the Face/Brush
attributes button displays the Brush Attributes dialog.  When texturing your
level, though, you must assign textures to and change the attributes of individual
faces.
<P>
When you switch the editor to Face mode, you can select a face by clicking on
it in the textured view, or by using the left and right arrow keys to move to
the previous and next faces in order.  You are restricted from moving entities,
or manipulating brushes when the editor is in Face mode.  To exit Face mode,
press the PgDn key to return to Brush mode.
<P>
The current mode (Face or Brush) is displayed on the status line at the bottom
of the editor window.
