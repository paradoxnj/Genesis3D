<P>
</B>When you want to see how your level will look in the finished program, you
have to compile the level and view it with a preview program.  The Compile
Manager dialog box allows you to set level compilation options and then start the
level build process.  After the level is built, you can view it with GTest, our sample program. Just make sure to include a DeathMatch Start entity for GTest to know where to start the player.
<P>
Select Tools|Compile from the menu (or click on the Compile button) to bring
up the Compile Manager dialog box.  This dialog box lets you control many
aspects of the compilation process, and also lets you preview the level after it has
compiled.
<P>
Level compilation consists of three steps that are performed in this order: 
creating the BSP tree from the exported geometry, calculating the potential
visible sets, and adding lighting effects to the level.  The Compile Manager dialog
box lets you control whether or not each of these steps is performed, and some
of the options.  In addition, some general settings let you control the
overall compilation process.
