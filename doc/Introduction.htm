<h2><a name="Introduction_WhatThisIs"></a>What is this?</h2>
<p>This is a software development kit (SDK) which allows you to build high performance 
  3D graphics applications such as games. Included in the SDK are tools for building 
  content for your application, binaries for building the applications themselves, 
  example code for using the SDK, and documentation.</p>
<h3>License</h3>
<p>We have adopted an OpenSource license for our engine. You agreed to the license 
  when you installed the software on your machine. We strongly encourage you to 
  read the details of the license. A text copy of the license can be found in 
  the OpenSource directory in the installation.</p>
<h2><a name="Introduction_WhatItCanDo"></a>What can it do?</h2>
<p>The engine is designed primarily to render indoor scenes with moderate polygon 
  count at very high performance. It can be used to build reasonably detailed 
  and extensive outdoor scenes provided that care is taken to build those scenes 
  correctly. The engine has support for fast collision detection, and precalculated 
  lighting and visibility testing. </p>
<h2><a name="Introdcution_WhatItCantDo"></a>What can it not do?</h2>
<p>The engine is not designed to render unlimited outdoor terrain currently. It 
  is not designed for fast culling of arbitrary non-sealed geometry. You should 
  not expect to build enormous scenes with high polygon counts and no visibility 
  inhibitors (walls) and get a high frame rate.  If you want  to build outdoor scenes
 with the current engine, you should limit the scene size and use Gouraud shading
 of the outdoor faces to limit texture thrashing. Also, try the new far clipping plane 
 with distance fogging.
  See the editor documentation and our FAQ sheets for more information on this.</p>
