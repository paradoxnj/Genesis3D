<h2><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>

<p>The SDK is comprised of libraries and headers for building your application, 
  tools for building your application content, and example code to show you the 
  basic capabilities of the engine. Documentation is provided to bind this all 
  together. The manifest below here should provide a roadmap into the layout of 
  the SDK, clearing up any questions about what is redistributable, and which 
  parts of the SDK pertain to which other parts. Finally, the complete source 
  to the engine and tools is included under the OpenSource directory. These sources 
  are covered by our open source license. Refer to license.txt in the OpenSource 
  directory for more information.</p>

<h2><a name="Libraries"></a>Libraries and Headers</h2>

<p>The libraries and headers are the pieces that are required to
actually build your application. </p>

<p>The <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">include</font>
directory contains the comprehensive list of header files that
define all the externally available interfaces in the engine. You
may not modify these files. The main header file for the
Genesis3D API is GENESIS.H. Including this header will cause most
of the other headers to be included. Most of the other headers
have been designed to stand on their own, or with minimall
support from other subsystems. If your application is a tool, or
is interested in only a subset of the Genesis3D APIs (e.g.
Actors), you should include the headers that are relevant, and
not the entirety of GENESIS.H. See the documentation on the
subsystems under Engine API to get a more complete description of
which subsystems depend on the others.</p>

<p>The lib directory holds the different libraries that you will
need to link. You only need one of the libraries provided in any
given application. The differences between the libraries are
detailed in this table:</p>

<table border="1" width="75%">
    <tr>
        <td width="29%"><b>Library Name</b></td>
        <td width="71%"><b>Purpose</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td width="29%"><font size="2"
        face="Courier New, Courier, mono">genesis.lib</font></td>
        <td width="71%">Static link, non-debug library</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td width="29%" height="13"><font size="2"
        face="Courier New, Courier, mono">genesisd.lib</font></td>
        <td width="71%" height="13">Static link, debug library</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td width="29%"><font size="2"
        face="Courier New, Courier, mono">genesisi.lib</font></td>
        <td width="71%">Dynamic link, non-debug library</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td width="29%"><font size="2"
        face="Courier New, Courier, mono">genesisid.lib</font></td>
        <td width="71%">Dynamic link, debug library</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>The dynamic link libraries are provided should you choose to
use genesis.dll You may need to use the DLL form of the library
if your application is broken into DLLs. Multiple parts of an
application must use the same copy of the Genesis3D libraries,
currently.</p>

<p>The bin directory contains genesis.dll. The bin\debug
directory contains the debug version of genesis.dll. If you build
with the dynamic link libraries, you will have to copy the
corresponding version of the DLL (debug/non-debug) to the working
directory of the application for it to load properly.
Alternatively, you can copy the DLL to the system directory for
Windows. We do not recommend this.</p>

<p>The debug versions of the libraries provide much stronger
parameter checking and runtime sanity tests than the release
libraries, and are consequently significantly slower. They can,
however, detect problems at a much higher level than can the
release libraries. Some of the runtime checks can be configured
programmatically (see geXForm3d in the Engine API section). The
release libraries are compiled for speed. Many of the APIs in
release mode do no safety checking on their parameters and will
crash if you pass them bad data. This has been done to preserve
the performance of the engine. We strongly recommend that you run
frequently with the debug libraries.</p>

<p>The Genesis3D APIs have been compiled using the __fastcall
calling convention. This was done to maximize performance of
several frequently called APIs (geVec3d, geXForm3d,
geQuaternion). Unfortunately, Microsoft __fastcall convention
passes the first 2 parameters in registers, and the remainder on
the stack, while Borland __fastcall convention passes the first 3
parameters in registers. This has resulted in an incomatibilty
that we have not resolved as yet. Consequently, a wrapper must be
built in order to use our APIs with Borland tools. Such a wrapper
is not included in this SDK. See the section on Required External
Tools.</p>

<p>The libraries have been built with the multithreaded compiler
options enabled in all cases. This enables them to coexist
peacefully with applications that wish to use multiple threads
accessing the C/C++ runtime libraries. The APIs themselves,
however, are not guaranteed to be thread safe. You must not call
into the Genesis3D API from separate threads without ensuring for
yourself that the APIs are not being reentered. APIs which are
not subject to this restriction are noted in their summary
sections in the Engine API section. The decision to not make the
engine completely threadsafe was made in the interests of
preserving performance for the vast majority of applications.</p>

<h2><a name="Redistributables"></a>Redistributables</h2>

<p>Once you have built your application, you will need to package
it up and distribute it. The packaging of the content is up to
you. However, there are a few files from the SDK that you may
need to distribute with your application. Primarily, these are
the render drivers that the engine employs to interface to the
hardware on your machine. If you use the dynamic link libraries,
you will also have to distribute the Genesis3D DLL (genesis.dll).
Below are listed the redistributable files that you are free to
distribute from the SDK without shipping the entire, unmodified
SDK:</p>

<table border="1" width="75%">
    <tr>
        <td width="34%"><b>File</b></td>
        <td width="66%"><b>Purpose</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td width="34%">bin\genesis.dll</td>
        <td width="66%">Non-debug version of the Genesis3D API
        DLL</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td width="34%">bin\debug\genesis.dll</td>
        <td width="66%">Debug version of the Genesis3D API DLL</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td width="34%">bin\softdrv.dll</td>
        <td width="66%">Non-debug version of the software
        rasterizer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td width="34%">bin\debug\softdrv.dll</td>
        <td width="66%">Debug version of the software rasterizer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td width="34%">bin\d3ddrv.dll</td>
        <td width="66%">Non-debug version of the D3D render
        driver</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td width="34%">bin\debug\d3ddrv.dll</td>
        <td width="66%">Debug version of the D3D render driver</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td width="34%">bin\glidedrv.dll</td>
        <td width="66%">Non-debug version of the Glide render
        driver</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td width="34%">bin\debug\glidedrv.dll</td>
        <td width="66%">Debug version of the Glide render driver</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>The files in the above table, along with the example
application files, comprise the <b><i>only</i></b> files that you
are allowed to redistribute if you do not ship the entire
unmodified SDK with your application.</p>

<p>A note on the D3D render driver: The Genesis3D engine can use
Microsoft DirectX version 6.0 or better to render scenes using 3D
hardware. If you distribute an application which requires this
support, you should not assume that D3D has already been
installed on the user's machine. It is your responsibility to see
that this is the case. WildTangent  does not
redistribute the DirectX 6.0 engine.</p>

<h2><a name="Tools"></a>Tools</h2>

<h4>Editor</h4>

<p>An editor (GEDIT.EXE) is provided to allow you to build 3d
geometry for your levels. The editor is based upon constructive
solid geometry (CSG) techniques, and has powerful features for
generating complex geometry. Some features of the editor include
subtractive brushes, keyframing of world geometry, customizeable
user data for levels and advanced lighting support. See the
editor documentation for full details on the capabilities of the
editor.</p>

<h4>Actor Studio</h4>

<p>The Actor Studio (ASTUDIO.EXE) is a GUI tool which simplifies
the job of building Actors using 3DS Max compatible files, or export files
exported with our exporters. Use this tool to take the animated
meshes that you have created in 3DS Max and build Genesis3D
Actors from them.</p>

<h4>Actor Builder</h4>

<p>The Actor Builder (ACTBUILD.EXE) is a command line tool which
will build projects created with Actor Studio. This tool is
helpful for doing automated builds.</p>

<h4>Actor Viewer</h4>

<p>The actor viewer (ACTVIEW.EXE) allows you to view actors that
you have built with the Actor Studio. You can blend motions with
it, or play individual motions to get a preview of how the mesh
will look in your application.</p>

<h4>Texture Packer</h4>

<p>The texture packer (TPACK.EXE) lets you build the texture
libraries that the editor and level compilation tools use. This
is a simple drag and drop tool which takes regular BMP files in
8bit palletized format. To use it, just run TPACK, open an
explorer window, and drag bitmaps over to the packer. Save the
resulting texture library to a file, and point the editor to it.
For information on how to set the editor's default texture
library, see the editor documentation.</p>

<h4>3DS Max exporters </h4>

<p>We have provided two sets of exporters each for both 3DS Max version 2.5
 and version 3.0, which are needed to export geometry for building with our 
Actor tools. The files are KEYEXP.DLE and NFOEXP.DLE (root directory for 2.5,
 /R3 for version 3.0). The appropriate set must be installed as plugins for 
3DS Max in order for you to be able to the Actor Studio to build 3d animated meshes 
for the engine.</p>

<h2><a name="ExampleApp"></a>Example Application</h2>

<p>We have provided a fully functional first person shooter game
which supports deathmatch play via modem or LAN as an example of
one application that you can build with the Genesis3D SDK. We
built this application because it appealed to a large number of
people, and enabled us to gain interest amoung the game
development community, at the same time demonstrating the
capability of the engine.</p>

<p>You are free to do whatever you want with all of the content
and code in the example, with no restrictions, whatsoever. This
applies to the following directories:</p>

<table border="1" width="51%" height="141">
    <tr>
        <td><b>Directory</b></td>
        <td><b>Contents</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>levels</td>
        <td>Game levels</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>bmp</td>
        <td>Game miscellaneous graphics</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td height="26">wav</td>
        <td height="26">Sounds</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>actors</td>
        <td>3D Actor meshes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>src</td>
        <td>Complete game source code</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2><a name="Dependencies"></a>Required External Tools</h2>

<p>Genesis3D was built with Microsoft Visual C++. The example code was built with 
  MS VC++ version 6.0. You must have at least MS VC++ 6.0 or better to use the 
  SDK to build Genesis3D applications.</p>

<p>Provided in the tools are two sets of exporters that support 3DS Max
version 2.5 and version 3.0. These exporters, and the attendant tools are the
only tools that we provide to build Actors with. If you wish to use
these tools, you will need to have 3DS Max version 2.5 or 3.0 with
Character Studio version 2.0 installed on your machine.</p>

<p>We have provided all of the APIs needed to build exporters for arbitrary 3d 
  modelling tools to build actors. 3rd party efforts have successfully built exporters
 for various modelling tools as an alternative. Check our web site 
  (www.genesis3d.com) for further information about exporters that others have 
  made available. Because WildTangent uses 3DS Max for its projects, 
  we will only be supporting 3DS Max directly with our tools for the forseeable 
  future.</p>
