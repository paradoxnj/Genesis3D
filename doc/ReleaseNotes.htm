<h1 align="center">Release Notes For Genesis3D 1.1</h1>
<p>Welcome to the 1.1 version release of the Genesis3D SDK from WildTangent, Inc.</p>
<p>For more information, please visit us at: <a href="http://www.genesis3d.com">www.genesis3d.com</a> 
</p>
<h2>Running The Demo</h2>
<p>There is a single shortcut for running the game in the Genesis3D folder. The 
  game will start up with a menu, from which you can choose multiplayer games, 
  or standalone. There are no enemies in the standalone game, so that version 
  becomes a simple exploration. You might want to check out the options page for 
  setting your name and configuring controls for the game, especially if you are 
  going to play a net game. </p>
<p>For network games, the server must start first, then the clients can join the 
  game. If you are running using an ISP, and not over the LAN, then you need to 
  communicate your IP address to your friends before they can join your game. 
  Use winipcfg.exe that ships with Windows to get this information. Your friends 
  will have to enter the IP address in the Join Network Game menu option. </p>
<p>You can run the game from the command line. The command line arguments are:

<p>The editor will ensure that your levels land in the correct place by default. 
  If you decide to change the default location of level files, you must put the 
  result in the LEVELS directory in order for the game to load it. For example, 
  if you installed Genesis3D to c:\Genesis3D11, you would put your level in c:\Genesis3D11\levels. 
  To test your level in the game, run the game as follows: </p>
<p> GTest -map foo.bsp -server -name George </p>
<p><b>Note:</b> If you want to edit and rebuild the levels that are included with 
  GTest, you will have to set the path options in the editor. Go to the Options 
  | Level Options menu, and alter the Headers path to reflect the proper location 
  of the installed SDK.</p>
<p>The install procedure does not create a needed 'Objects' directory. If you 
  want to use premade object support in the editor, you will have to create this 
  directory. </p>
<p>The editor requires CTL3D32.DLL to run. If you get a message that this DLL 
  is not present, you can copy the DLL from Redist\ctl3d32.dll to your Windows\System 
  directory to fix this. </p>
