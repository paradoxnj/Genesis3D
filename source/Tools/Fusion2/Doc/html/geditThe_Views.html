<P>
</B>There are four Views:  a Textured view that shows a 3-dimensional rendering of
the level, and three orthographic views that give Top, Front, and Side views
of the level.  You do all of your geometry editing in the three orthographic
views.  The Textured view is used for viewing the level and also for selecting
geometry and entities that you can then edit in the orthographic views.
<P>
Note that the Textured view is an approximation of the level's final
appearance--not an exact representation of how the level will appear when it's rendered
by the Genesis engine.  In order to save time when displaying the level in the
editor, the Textured view does not display any effects of lighting, so the
display in the Textured view will not be of as high quality as the final compiled
version of the level.
