</B>Brush groups allow you to select a bunch of geometry and/or entities and group
them into a named collection which you can then hide or select. This allows
you to work with greater speed in a number of ways.
<P>
First, you can group large areas of geometry together and hide it in order to
unclutter the views. When a level becomes complex, there is frequently a large
amount of excess geometry in the views that you are not interested in at any
particular point in time. Hiding parts of the level like this allows you to more
easily select and manipulate the geometry that you are most interested in.
<P>
Geometry which is grouped and hidden is not included when displaying the level
in the textured view, which can dramatically improve the editor's performance
when dealing with complex levels.
<P>
Geometry which is grouped and hidden is not used when compiling the level,
which means that the time required to compile the level can be greatly reduced by
hiding large parts of the level. This becomes very important when you're
texturing and lighting a level because you'll be making many small changes and
recompiling frequently. Building a level with lighting--especially radiosity
lighting--takes a long time.
<P>
This is where brush groups can help. Since you're typically lighting a single
room at a time, you can group and hide all but the room on which you're
working. Then, when you build the level only that room will be compiled. This will
take much less time than rebuilding the entire level. You will still have to do a
full radiosity build with all groups visible periodically to work on portions
of the level that require light blending between rooms, and for the final level,
but you should be able to save a considerable amount time by working on a
single room at a time.
<P>
In addition to the Groups option page, on which you can control individual
groups' visibility, three toolbar buttons allow you to control which groups are
displayed by the editor and used when compiling the level. If the All Groups
button is selected, then all groups are displayed, regardless of their individual
visibily attributes. If the Visible Groups button is selected, then only those
groups that have their individual visibility flags set will be displayed. If the
Current Group button is selected, then only the currently-selected group is
displayed.
