<P>
</B>When you place a cut brush in the world, it carves into any other brush with
which it comes into contact, provided that the other brush was created <I>before</I> the cut brush was created.  Sometimes, you'll want to create a solid brush
and have it carved by a cut brush that was created before your new brush.  To
make this possible, the Tools|Brush|Make Newest menu command (or N shortcut key)
will move the selected brush to the end of the brush list--effectively making it
the last-created brush.  If you use this command to make an existing cut brush
&quot;newest,&quot; then it will carve into all other brushes in the level with which it
comes into contact.
