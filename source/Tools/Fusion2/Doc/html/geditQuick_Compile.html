<P>
</B>Level designers often build all of the geometry for a level and texture the
individual faces before going through and adding final lighting effects.  Because
the editor</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="5">’</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">s textured view doesn</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="5">’</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">t display lighting effects, lighting a level requires many edit, compile, view
iterations.  To lessen the amount of time required for the compile phase, the
Compile Manager dialog box gives you the option of telling the level compiler
that only the entities (lights) in a level were changed.  If the compiler has
the information left over from its last compile (which it usually will), then it
can do a much faster compile by skipping the BSP and visibility steps and going
directly into lighting.  This one option can cut a 40-minute compile time down
to less than 2 minutes.
<P>
To do a quick compile, bring up the Compile Manager dialog box and check the </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="5">“</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Entities Only</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="5">”</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> check box.  When this box is checked, the BSP and Vis settings on the dialog
are greyed out because the compiler will not perform those steps.
